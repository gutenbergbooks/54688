<h2>American Missionary Association.</h2>

<p>Among the list of our workers in the February number, two names
were in some unaccountable way omitted. We hasten to supply them
here—Mrs. H. B. Northrop is our missionary at New Orleans, La., and
Rev. P. W. Young the pastor of our church at Byron, Ga.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our lady teachers are also missionaries. The lady missionaries
sent out by the Woman’s Boards often find their first and most
effective means of access to the people in the schools they start
for girls. Our one hundred and fifteen lady teachers are doing the
work of Christian training along with that of school teaching, and
are missionaries nearly as much as the seven ladies who devote
themselves exclusively to direct mission work. They have a right to
consider themselves as missionaries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We notice in the list of officers of the First State Sunday-school
Convention of Louisiana, the name of Rev. W. S. Alexander,
President of Straight University and pastor of the Central
Congregational Church of New Orleans, as one of the Vice-Presidents
and also of the Executive Committee. He was chairman of the
Committees of Credentials and on the Constitution. Dr. Roy was
also present. Certainly there is no cause for a complaint of lack
of recognition of those engaged in our work in the midst of such
examples as these.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The question how to interest the Sunday-schools in missionary work
has met with a new answer in the cordial reception and use of our
Jubilee Concert Exercise. Five large editions have been exhausted,
and now a second Exercise has been prepared (No. 2), in which a
number of questions are to be answered by as many persons as there
are letters in the alphabet, covering the main facts of our various
work. Five Jubilee Songs are inserted to be sung by a choir, and
place is left for short addresses. We commend it to our friends,
who will receive as many copies as they need for use, gratuitously,
by applying to Dist. Sec. Pike.</p>

<p>It is with profound sadness that we record the death of two of
our most esteemed co-laborers in the administration of missionary
work. The Rev. Charles P. Bush, D. D., for many years associated
with all our churches, especially in the Middle States, as the
District Secretary of the A. B. C. F. M., has not only enjoyed the
confidence, but won the love, of pastors and people on every hand.
We shall miss him greatly. The Rev. Robert L. Dashiell, D. D., the
Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, has been a tower of strength not only to the broad
missionary enterprises of that denomination, but, by his genial
sympathy and wise counsels, has added to the efficiency and courage
of his brethren in the work outside of his own organization.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We much regret to learn of the death of Miss Dell Safford, formerly
a teacher under this Association. For six years, she labored
faithfully and conscientiously among the Freedmen in Talladega
and Selma, Ala. She was patient and untiring in her efforts for
the real good of those under her instruction, and her interest in
them did not flag even after she left the field, but showed itself
especially in the care she exercised over one of her pupils, whom
she had brought with her that he might receive the benefits of a
Northern education. After leaving the service of this Society,
she removed to Wisconsin. But a cold taken in the spring, when
she was already overworked and worn, could not be controlled,
and consumption followed. She died at the last very suddenly of
hemorrhage.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<p>One of the most hopeful signs of the times in the missionary field
is seen in the increasing demand and the corresponding supply of
missionary intelligence. The <cite>Missionary Herald</cite> has enlarged its
space between the borders, and fills it with valuable matter. Its
strong point is, as it has been, its full and valuable letters from
the front. The <cite>Foreign Missionary</cite> of the Presbyterian Board has
been of late renewing its youth, and coming up, until it has become
the most suggestive and vivacious of all the periodicals of the
kind which meet our eyes. But nowadays, when intelligent people
read the doings of all the world every morning at their breakfast
tables, and are no longer satisfied with the village or the county
news, they must have something which shall give them broader views
of the great field of missions, which is the world, than they can
obtain from the organs of special societies.</p>

<p>To meet this want, the societies themselves are increasingly
informing their constituency that there is other work being done
than that they do themselves. “The work of other societies”
is becoming a familiar heading. Even this, however, does not
answer the full demands—and that the day has come for missionary
periodicals, which are edited and circulated upon the same basis
as those which deal with scientific or material progress, shows
that the broader interests of the coming kingdom are taking more
fully their appropriate place in the hearts and minds of Christian
men and women. The <cite>Missionary Review</cite>, which has been published
for more than two years from Princeton, New Jersey, and which as
an unsparing critic of existing missionary societies, is adapted
to promote great circumspection in those who administer them, is
re-enforced in this general field by <cite>The Gospel in all Lands</cite>,
edited by Rev. Albert B. Simpson, and published by Randolph,
which will give itself to the broader aspects and principles of
missionary work, and to a compilation of fresh intelligence from
all<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a> quarters. We rejoice in all such methods for the diffusion of
knowledge, and the stimulation of interest, in carrying out “the
great commission.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<p>“<cite>Through the Light Continent</cite>” is a comely octavo in elegant type,
from the London press, giving the observations of William Saunders
on a tour taken through our country in 1877–8. In a chapter upon
“Education in Atlanta,” after speaking of the Public Schools, he
says: “One of the most interesting institutions of Atlanta is
the University for the education of colored persons, under the
superintendence of Professor Ware. The Atlanta University has 175
students (the last catalogue made them 244), half of whom pay
the fees and cost of board. Many young negroes have worked, and
saved up $200 or $300 in order to come to the University. It will
thus be seen that the energy which the negroes are manifesting to
obtain education is not confined to the ordinary work of the Board
of Schools, but extends to the higher branches of learning. About
75 of the students are girls, and their progress is regarded as
universally satisfactory.</p>

<p>Professor and Mrs. Ware, who have devoted their lives to this work
with true missionary zeal, are now much cheered to find their
labors recognized and encouraged in quarters from which persistent
opposition was formerly experienced. When they came to Atlanta,
any manifestation of regard for the blacks was looked upon as an
act of hostility to the whites; but a great change has taken place
in public opinion, and it is now generally felt that national
advancement requires the elevation of the negro race, and those who
undertake their education are no longer regarded with disfavor.</p>

<p>There are many societies in the Northern States for promoting
numerous enterprises amongst the negroes. Before reaching Atlanta,
I noticed a large crowd of negroes at one of the wayside stations,
and found the occasion to be the leaving of a missionary, who had
been working amongst them for two or three years, and was then
changing his station. The respect and regard paid to him and to his
wife were pleasant to see; the missionary was a most intelligent
travelling companion, evidently devoted to his work in the genuine
spirit of Christianity.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>TWENTY PER CENT.</h3>

<p>The enthusiasm evinced at the last Annual Meeting, our freedom
from the long-borne burden of our debt, the general interest which
seemed to be renewed in the welfare of the Freedmen, and the
commencing and anticipated prosperity in the financial world, all
conspired to encourage us to plan and prepare for an enlarged work
and more abundant results. In carrying out these purposes, the
Executive Committee have appropriated about <em>twenty per cent.</em> more
than in the previous year to the Southern field.</p>

<p>The total receipts thus far have been very gratifying,—and yet,
when we come to analyze them, we find that they are, in a larger
measure than formerly, sent to us to be appropriated to special
departments of the work, or more often to special work not included
in our estimates. This is both gratifying and embarrassing:
gratifying, because it indicates an increasing familiarity with
the details of our work, and special sympathy with this or that
portion of the whole; but embarrassing, because it cannot fail to
be a diversion of funds which have been anticipated by us to meet
the appropriations already made to new fields, and often to create,
instead of covering, expense.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></p>

<p>We recognize these needs, of student aid, of woman’s work, and of
special endowment, and we would not have these particular demands
neglected. It is only that if all the money were to be thus
specifically applied by the donors, there would be none left for
the main work, on which the ability to carry on all the specialties
depends. Don’t starve the body in order to enlarge the hand or the
foot. The best growth of all is that which comes from the food,
which enters by the mouth into the stomach, and, vitalized, is
carried through the whole system. If you appropriate all the fuel
on the steamer to the donkey engines, what will you do with the
great machinery whose work it is to revolve the main propeller? If
in your city water-works, you enlarge the side supply pipes and
leave the old mains, you get not more, but less, water into the
houses.</p>

<p>What do we ask, then?—1. That your <em>special appropriations be
special gifts</em>, additions to, and not diversions of, the moneys you
are wont to give to the general work of the Association. 2. That
you do not fail in your church, or from your private purse, to give
us something <em>this year</em>. 3. That as you have encouraged us to lay
out a larger work, you send us for general uses at least <em>twenty
per cent.</em> more than you did last year.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>THE NEW PLEA.</h3>

<p>Henceforth the basis of our appeal to the churches ought to be
gratitude, not necessity; thankfulness, not the cry of sharp
distress; the impulse kindled at the sight of opening fields,
widening opportunities, intelligent appreciation of service done
and rewarding results.</p>

<p>The large additions to the churches in the foreign field, their
increasing spirit of benevolence, the awakening interest in the
cause of education, the world-wide readiness and call for helpers,
the cheering indications of an abundant harvest of souls, soon to
be gathered, the overwhelming demand in our own land for immediate
work upon the frontier and at the South, among the depressed races
and the incoming population, the return of prosperous times, and
the ever-pressing command of Christ, are considerations so potent,
so eloquent in their united plea, that the first thought of him who
listens is, “How can any Christian heart resist the new plea!” What
can hinder a most liberal investment in causes that promise such
rich returns?</p>

<p>Instead of exhausting all the strength of the crew at the pumps in
a desperate endeavor to save the ship from sinking, has the time
not come, when, with canvas all spread, and the ship sea-worthy,
rightly headed and well under way, the main question shall be,
how to touch every harbor, explore every river, sail every inland
sea, and leave the precious freighting of the Gospel at every
port around the globe? Is it quite creditable to our piety, our
devotion, our loyalty to Christ, that we can resist appeals based
upon love, goodness, merciful interposition, glorious enlargement,
and wait until we are crowded to a reluctant response by the plea
of dire necessity, overshadowing peril?</p>

<p>There are most cheering indications that the new plea is becoming
effectual. We are informed of a number of instances in which
churches have lately nearly or quite doubled their contributions to
the American Board, and that, too, apparently with great heartiness
and joy. Gifts, also, from some private and unexpected sources
have been a cheering indication of the advance movement. The same
indications are, to a certain extent, true of the other Societies.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></p>

<p>A mid-summer appeal for larger and extra contributions, in order to
prevent a deficit, ought to be anticipated, and made impossible, by
ample gifts now. The volume of offerings during the <em>first half of
the year</em>, ought to be so large as to remove all anxiety concerning
the state of the treasuries of these Societies when their accounts
close. How pleasant, if, at the annual meetings, the friends could
be surprised with reports of a surplus instead of deficits.</p>

<p>Ought there not to be a stern purpose to pay as we go, and to
pay with sufficient liberality to enable us to go with vigor and
dispatch to the utmost bound of a rapidly increasing demand? May
the plea of great interposition, great opportunity and great
ability find fitting response.—<cite>The Advance.</cite></p>

<h3>CONGREGATIONALISM IN THE SOUTH.</h3>

<p>We reprint the following article from the <cite>Christian Recorder</cite>,
the able organ of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. It is a
significant endorsement of the church work done by the Association,
and from those who are most profoundly concerned in the Christian
elevation of the colored people of the land. We have not even
omitted the sharp criticism of the approving words of those who
gathered at Chicago to review our work, hoping that we may thus
escape the charge of “Phariseeism” in accepting the commendations
and congratulations of our brethren of the A. M. E. Church:</p>

<p>“The thirty-third Annual Report of the American Missionary
Association is before us. We wish that we could place the Report
in the hands of every A. M. E. preacher in the land. Years ago
we called attention to the fact that the A. M. A. was destined
to become the strongest competitor the A. M. E. would find in
the South. As we declared, it is even now seen. The twenty-three
Congregational churches of 1869 have become sixty-seven in 1879.
But it may be said, what is sixty-seven churches with a membership
of 4,600, compared to our thousands? They would not be much, to
be sure, were they of the same general material. But they are
not. They are, as it were, a picked body. In a sense they may be
said to occupy the same relation to our Church as the regular
army sustains to the volunteer force of the country. And we all
know what that means. A thousand regulars can do the work of ten
thousand volunteers. Is it asked, How is this? The answer is at
hand. Each Congregational church grew out of the school which the
Congregational preacher in the person of a teacher taught. Knowing
his material, and wielding it much as the potter wields the clay,
he occupied for his church a position decidedly advantageous; and
the result shows that he has not failed to profit by it.</p>

<p>“In nothing that we have said is it to be supposed that we are in
wrath at their manifest success. Of course, we have no patience
with the spirit of Phariseeism breathed forth in the report of the
Committee on Church Work in the South. Nothing that the typical
Pharisee of the New Testament said excels it; but for the work
itself of these, our companions in the kingdom and patience of
Jesus Christ, we entertain the highest possible respect; begging,
however, the privilege of suggesting that next year’s report be not
so strenuously self-complacent.</p>

<p>“And now we repeat what we have so often said to our brother
ministers, especially of the South, where they are brought in
contact with this energetic body of men: Know, once for all, that
the Church possessed of the best cultured heads and the best
cultured hearts, is to win. That we are infinitely stronger in
numbers to-day than are the Congregationalists, argues nothing
for the future. <a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a>It is with churches as with everything else, the
fittest survives. If African Methodism prove to be that fittest,
it will survive. If not, it must inevitably pass away, and only
be remembered as a thing of the past. To be the fittest, it
is required that she banish all ignorance, all immorality and
superstition from her midst. This must be done, let the cost be
what it may. Thin out the ministry of the church until there shall
not be found an ignorant man nor a bad man in the ranks. Thin out
the church itself. Expel the vicious. Drive out the notoriously
bad. Have a clean church. Let such steps as these be taken, and
African Methodism will have a future that will be to the glory of
God and the best interests of mankind. But if she draw back, let
her remember that God can take no pleasure in her.”</p>

<h3>IGNORANCE OF THE NEGRO QUESTION.</h3>

<p>From a paper read by W. N. Armstrong, Esq., before the Yale Alumni
Association of New York in January, as printed in <cite>The Present
Century</cite>:</p>

<p>There is an astounding ignorance in the North regarding the
conditions and relations of the blacks and whites of the South. The
North in full control of the National Government for many years,
has had before it a vast and complicated problem in statesmanship.
Instead of working at it intelligently, it has lost itself in a fog
of political prejudice, and is not ready at this late day to take
an honest look into the matter.</p>

<p>For the last fifteen years what have we known of the South,
especially of the blacks? What steps have we taken to ascertain the
actual truth regarding four millions of negroes whom we suddenly
railroaded into our political system? When the General Government
wished to obtain facts concerning the geological, botanical and
mineral character of the Western territory, it sent out experts
skilled in examining, testing, classifying and surveying. These men
were kept in the field for years, and their reports fill a score
of volumes, and now we know something about the plains and the
mountains. For the intricate social questions of the South, that
vast tract of unknown land, that section of the Dark Continent in
America, we have neither expert or surveyor, or intelligent process
of examination, though the demands for accuracy in social science
are as imperative as in physical. Visiting statesmen have been
there. But was a visiting statesman ever known to report a fact
which hurt his party?</p>

<p>Northern men who are in the South for the purpose of getting office
will not tell the truth, because it may bear against them. Southern
men, as a rule, do not report the real facts, because they are
prejudiced. Northern men who have become prosperous in business
at the South, long since discovered that silence was golden, and
their lips are sealed to the public. The testimony of the blacks
is the most unreliable of all for reasons which will be given
hereafter. The poor Northern men who have failed to make a fortune
in the South have a grievance, and cannot be trusted. It is upon
the newspaper correspondent that the North has relied mainly for
information. But he is always under limitations. One of them (whom
you all know by reputation) said to me—“We correspondents are not
sent here to find out the actual truth, but to support the theories
of the papers which send us. It won’t do for me to say in my
letters that the nigger is to blame, when the editorial columns of
my paper say the white men are in the wrong.” The newspaper makes
its theory first, or it inherits a theory, and then sends out for
facts to fit it. Does not every one know beforehand how every daily
paper in this city will treat any given political event? The best
sources of information regarding the blacks are<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a> his educators.
These men, all of them from the North, know something about the
negro. Though little enough as yet, Congress has never asked
these teachers to tell what they know about him. Facts regarding
the lives or the motives of men are not obvious. The newspaper
correspondent cannot reach them in an hour, or even in a year.
I have been personally familiar with a number of events in the
South. I have never known one of these to be correctly reported.
Has any lawyer of this city ever known one of his cases to be
reported accurately in the daily press? Truth seems to be in a
deep well everywhere. The <cite>Herald</cite> says Edison’s light is a great
success. The <cite>Nation</cite> is doubtful about it. An electrician of rare
skill tells me it is a humbug. If we cannot get at the truth about
matters near at home, what shall be expected regarding matters in a
distant section of the country?</p>

<p>The Republican believes what his newspaper tells him about the
South, and the Democrat does not believe it. They never unite for
investigation. The historian will say hereafter that the real
outrage was in our criminal neglect to ascertain the truth. It is
easy to see that it is supremely difficult to get at the facts
about two races jostling together, like huge vessels thumping and
pounding against each other in a rolling sea.</p>

<p>Last year the negro paper in Charleston, South Carolina, advocated
the election of a Democratic mayor. The Republican papers had no
use for that fact. It did not indicate the existence of outrages.
It was rather in the line of what Tyndall calls the tragedy of
science—a beautiful theory killed by an incontrovertible fact.
For two years the Democratic party of Georgia has been so broken
up that as many as six or seven independent Democratic tickets in
local issues have been in the field in many counties, and the white
candidate, who has captured a negro vote, sees to it with rifle and
revolver that no other white opponent interferes with that black
vote.</p>

<p>Facts like these occur by the hundred in Southern politics, but the
Republican press ignore them. The Northern men who are educating
the negro regard Captain Thompson, superintendent of public
schools in South Carolina, as one of the most efficient men of the
South in extending negro education; but the <cite>Tribune</cite> calls him
a bloody-shirt orator. The negro teacher is at present his best
friend, and his evidence about the whites should be credible if not
conclusive.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>AN ILLUSTRATED PRESS.</h3>

<p>We have received two communications lately in regard to the
importance of the Press in the education of the colored people—one
from an esteemed friend in the West, urging that other institutions
should follow the example of Hampton and Talladega in publishing
papers. We are not sure that this is altogether desirable. There
must be many favoring conditions to make it a success; otherwise
there is a certainty of pecuniary loss and wasted effort. The
other letter is from an English missionary in the West Indies, who
thus states the case as to the value of periodical literature to
supplement the influences of the church and the school:</p>

<p>“There remains, as a means of elevating and advancing the colored
people, the Press. The periodical Press has been of untold service
in promoting the civilization of the English and American white
laborers. It has come into their homes, arousing them, week by
week, with fresh power and stimulus. It has filled their homes
with pictures of beauty, which delighted themselves and their
children, and taught them, indirectly, (and therefore most
effectually,) lessons of thrift,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a> neatness and refinement. Every
picture of a clean, neatly-dressed child, of a well-kept home, of
a happy fireside group, etc., etc., carried its lesson and left
its impress, suggesting imitation, and stimulating efforts for
improvement.</p>

<p>“Now, what periodicals are there in the whole wide world that
will thus encourage, stimulate and arouse the colored people? Not
one. I have not met with any English or American publication at
all suited to their needs. It is a common remark of the people
here, when asked to adopt some reform: ‘That will do for <em>white</em>
people; but it is not for we.’ And if the <cite>British Workman</cite>, or
any similar paper, is placed in their hands, it but intensifies
this feeling. The contrast between themselves and white people is
constantly before them. Week after week they will see pictures of
pleasant homes and scenes in home life, and in every case these are
connected with the home of the <em>white</em> man. If, by chance, some
colored face is shown, it is as a curiosity, like a Modoc Indian, a
Chinaman or a Zulu.</p>

<p>“What is urgently needed is something that will meet the needs
of colored laborers, in periodical literature, as the needs of
the white laboring classes are now met. I think that there should
without delay be established in America some new periodical—or some
periodical now established should be so modified in the manner of
conducting it—that, pursuing the broad lines of humanity, would
secure two things:</p>

<p>“1.—In the illustrations, the manhood of the colored man would
receive recognition, and <em>his</em> home, <em>his</em> children, incidents
of <em>his</em> life, would appear from time to time, in such way as
to convey to all colored people a feeling of emulation, a hope
and inspiration, stimulating them to achieve better things for
themselves.</p>

<p>“2.—In the letter-press, care would be taken to avoid those figures
of speech which carry with them an implied degradation of the
colored people. To illustrate, what is ‘foul’ would not be made
synonymous with what is ‘black.’”</p>

<p>There is certainly sound reason in the above suggestions, and it
would seem that good results might follow the proposed plan. Just
how it is to be done is the question. The paying constituency
of such a paper would probably be too small to make it a matter
of mere business enterprise. Perhaps to some one the good to be
accomplished may seem large enough and direct enough to warrant the
needed outlay of thought, time and capital.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>ITEMS FROM THE FIELD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Raleigh, N. C.</span>—Great religious interest is reported
throughout the city. Our little church is sharing in the great
blessing—church members are being revived and others are inquiring
the way of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodbridge, N. C.</span>—During the last two weeks we have had a
remarkable outpouring of the Spirit. On two afternoons we have had
to suspend the school exercises on account of those weeping over
their sins. Some little ones will not leave the house till they
feel forgiven. Almost all are from the Band of Hope. The older ones
look on in surprise at such a work among the children. Some have
tried to stop their children from praying, but they could come to
school and pray, or go out in the woods till they were converted,
and then they couldn’t help it. We have a daily prayer-meeting in
the school-house, in which all take part. Sometimes we have open
meetings for the children. We have nightly revival meetings, in
which the children are taking hold as far as it seems advisable.</p>

<p><em>Later.</em>—One Saturday, four came to tell us of sins forgiven. Since
then, for<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a> three weeks, almost every day has brought one or more,
till about thirty have believed, and several others are anxious.
Most of these are children; a few are pretty small. To-day some of
them have been praying, all their spare time, that they may be able
to hold out to the end.</p>

<p>It is a time of struggle here. People are so poor as to hardly have
enough to eat of the poorest fare, and clothing is pretty scarce.
No capital in the place. They spin and weave their own garments,
even to the thread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Macon, Ga.</span>—Bro. B. arrived on the 23d of February, and we
began our special meetings the next night. We had several extra
prayer meetings the previous week, when much earnest prayer was
offered for God’s blessing to come upon us. All things seemed to be
in readiness, the brethren of the church are already quickened, and
the meetings have been very encouraging from the start. The members
have taken hold with commendable zeal, and seem to be thoroughly
united. The meeting last night (March 3d) was almost a Pentecostal
season. There are fifteen or twenty inquirers, of the most hopeful
class of young men and women, and some intelligent middle-aged men.
The work is quiet and deep, without noise or nonsense, and seems to
be spreading every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selma, Ala.</span>—When I last wrote, I think we were
anticipating the week of prayer with hope of some awakening. We
observed the days with very good attendance and very good results
in quickening members, still the expected ingathering of souls has
not been realized. Otherwise we think the church is in quite a
flourishing condition. Since the week of prayer, we have sustained
three or four cottage meetings every week, with good results, and
with the Literary Society, sociables, ladies’ weekly and monthly
meetings, and regular prayer meetings and teachers’ meetings, we
have managed to keep quite busy.</p>

<h3>GENERAL NOTES.</h3>


<h4>The Indians.</h4>

<p>—The House Committee on Indian Affairs has agreed to a bill which
proposes to place all that part of the Indian Territory not set
apart to, and occupied by, the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and
Seminole Indians, under the jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the District of Kansas, held at Fort Scott,
in respect to the crimes of murder, manslaughter, arson, rape,
burglary and robbery. The exemptions, above stated, are placed
by the bill under United States District Court for Arkansas. The
bill further extends the provisions of the laws of the respective
States wherein are located Indian reservations to the reservations
themselves.</p>

<p>—A bill is now pending before the Indian Committee of the House,
upon which Governor Pound, a member of the committee and an
enthusiastic student of the Indian question, has made a favorable
report, providing for a number of Indian schools similar to that at
Carlisle; and it was in this connection that a visit of inspection
was recently made by Secretary Schurz, several members of the House
Committee on Indian Affairs, and two members of the Board of Indian
Commissioners. Besides the general advantages to result directly
from education of Indian youths, it is represented in support of
the measure that the presence of a number of children from each
tribe at schools in the East will be a most efficient guarantee of
good behavior on the part of the tribes.</p>

<p>It would seem, judging from the meagre opportunities for inspection
offered<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a> by a single visit to Carlisle, that the movement promises
to be an effectual aid, if not ultimately one of the chief
instruments, in settling the vexed Indian problem. If, however,
only a part of that which is expected is actually realized, still
it will have been a very profitable venture, both for the Indians
and for the Government.—<cite>N. Y. Tribune.</cite></p>

<h4>Africa.</h4>

<p class="center">Extract from a letter received by the London Missionary Society:</p>

<p>—“Food continues cheap and plentiful; the market is a great
blessing—it fluctuates frequently, but the cause can generally be
seen; a recent rise in prices was caused by the sudden arrival of
several caravans of ivory from Manyuema. We are doing a little
better with the garden just now. One of our new men formerly worked
in an Arab’s garden, and under his advice and care we have onions
now coming up, and some of the seeds from Cape Colony are showing
signs of life. We have a good plot of sweet potatoes. The vegetable
called nyumbo—mentioned by Livingstone as being very wholesome—is
now procurable in the market; we find them very good and much like
potatoes; in shape and size they are like good-sized long radishes
with blunt tails; in colour and texture like English potatoes, but
stringy outside. Good beef is not procurable. Fish, fowls, and
goat’s flesh are plentiful; also eggs and butter.</p>

<p>“Having a good supply of sugar we have tried preserving, and
succeeded very well with lemon marmalade and jam of bananas and
guavas. Mr. Hutley has acquired the art of bread-making, and we
occasionally have an excellent loaf. We both find the maize meal
wholesome; it is capable of being made into a variety of puddings.
If I were asked of what I am in want in the shape of food, I would
say, first, cabbages; second, rhubarb: and lo, only to-day, Mr.
Hutley tells me that some Savoy cabbage seeds are showing signs
of life! So we may yet, with care, obtain several of the English
vegetables, which beat anything in this country, with all its
luxuriance.</p>

<p>“Wheat planting begins in a few days, at which we shall also have a
try. I think it probable we shall be able to procure ‘whole-wheat
meal’ from Unyanyembe in the season at a reasonable price. Men who
know the roads in the forest go to Unyanyembe in eight days; this
seems to us very near.”</p>

<p class="secauth">MISS M. A. ANDRUS, CARRSVILLE.</p>

<p>Reading in the “Missionary” of the work done in the South, it
came into my mind to tell you of a work of grace here. Nearly all
of our Sabbath-school are converted. From sixty to seventy have
been baptized and received into this church, and since the 1st
of September the pastor has baptized 150. I have never before
labored in a Sabbath-school where I have felt so manifestly the
Spirit accompanying the word. It seemed to sink deep into the
hearts and take root there, and a harvest of souls is the result.
The pastor thinks the converts were more intelligent than<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a> usual,
and he imputed it to the instruction they had received in the
Sabbath-school. My method of instruction is, to expound the
Scriptures verse by verse, as read by each scholar, making special
application to each one individually, and so each one feels as if
he had a portion.</p>

<p>Sabbath before last, I had the blest privilege of seeing
forty-three of the converts all seated together in the front seats,
and it was to me an affecting sight. All ages were represented
there from the little child to the man of grey hairs.</p>

<p>I spoke to them of the joy it gave me to see them occupying such
a position, and of the joy to the angels of God over them, for
if there is joy in heaven among the angels over one sinner that
repenteth, how much more joy over such a number as I saw before me.</p>

<p>I read to them, “A charge to those who have just joined the
Church,” sent to me a few days before by Samuel B. Schieffelin
of New York, which seemed providentially to have come at that
time. They all listened with profound attention and seemed much
interested, and I trust a good and lasting impression was made upon
them.</p>

<p>After the reading, I presented each one with a copy of the
<cite>Charge</cite>, as it was in little book form, with which they seemed to
be much gratified.</p>

<h3>NORTH CAROLINA.</h3>

<p class="section">Facts About the Taught and the Teachers.</p>

<p class="secauth">MRS. ALFRED CONNET, M<sup>c</sup>LEANSVILLE.</p>

<p>We have been here seventeen months. During this time I have
refrained from expressing myself in regard to the negroes and our
work among them. Every day we are more and more convinced of their
deep degradation; in fact, it is entirely beyond anything we had
imagined.</p>

<p>They seem to be guilty of the whole category of sins, but,
perhaps, their untruthfulness is most prominent. We cannot have
a self-reporting system in school, but there are some noble
exceptions to the general rule.</p>

<p>The most pitiable objects are those women who have families, but
never had husbands. One such woman last fall told me that she was
going to gather “shoemake” (shumac) leaves that week, and get her
a pair of shoes. Saturday afternoon, she stopped on her way home
from the store. “Well, Aunty, did you get your shoes?” “No; Mr.
F. showed me so much purty caliker that I bought me a dress.” She
already had about a dozen calico dresses. “But what will you do for
shoes?” “I don’t know; but I prays to the good Lord to keep me from
getting sick when I get my feet wet.” I guess He heard her, for she
is well. In contrast with this, the woman who washes for us saves
up her wages and buys just what she and her child really need.</p>

<p>The women have not made as much advancement as the men; but there
is good reason for this. They have gone to the field as regularly
as the men, and have had their cooking and housework to do; and,
in addition to this, they have borne a child every year or two.
When they come to church they have these small children to care
for. They were pleased when they learned that the “new minister”
was glad to see them and their babies. It is hard to hold their
attention, they are so tired, and have so much to think about what
they shall eat and wear. We wish we could do them more good; but we
must turn our energies principally to the young.</p>

<p>Sin and temptation beset the young girls on every side, and, alas!
too many of them yield. One asked me in regard to that terrible,
nameless crime. I told her that the life of the child was just as
sacred before birth as after birth. She said that the crime was
quite common here. Mr. C. has since preached against it.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></p>

<p>Faith in God is very strong in some of them. One dear Aunty, who
has a very large family, and much to do, said: “When I feels so
tired, I just ask the Lord to give me strength to finish this
washing, or whatever I am doing, and he does it.” Her husband is
our Sunday-school Superintendent, and their children are the best
educated of any in the neighborhood. This family belongs to three
races—white, black and red—the latter predominating.</p>

<p>Some of the people seemed to get the idea that we were so anxious
for their children to attend school that they could dictate to
us, and they encouraged their children to rebel against necessary
government. One girl who ran away from school wrote a note
acknowledging her wrong and asking forgiveness; of course she was
gladly received back. Seven young men and two girls are doing their
own cooking so that they can remain longer. Five others are paying
board.</p>

<p>We have some very dull scholars. We have some bright ones. One
young man, fourteen months ago, did not know his letters. Now he
reads in National Third Reader and United States history, has
commenced grammar and geography, and is in fractions in arithmetic.
One pupil, who is a minister, is over thirty years of age. Three
other scholars are twenty-nine. Nearly all the larger ones are
teachers, or are preparing to teach. I think they will do much good
for their people.</p>

<p>I may be mistaken, but it seems to me that the negro does not
investigate or reason much, but acts according to his feelings.
Even the babies do not tear up their playthings to see what is
inside of them.</p>

<p>They are full of signs and superstitious notions. Our little girl,
Addie, showed a very small hen’s egg to some little girls. One of
them said: “My mother never allows us to take one into the house,
it is bad luck; but it is good luck to throw it over the house, and
we always do that.”</p>

<p>Mr. C. and I both teach six hours per day. Sometimes after school
we take the carriage and go to see some sick person. Last week
we went three miles to see one poor sick woman, who has lost the
use of one eye and is nearly blind in the other. She is a great
sufferer, but said, “My many afflictions and tribulations bring me
near the Lord, and I am so proud to see you all.” Last Saturday we
went four miles to see an old man who is probably on his death-bed.
He was sixty-three years a slave, is a Christian, has united with
the church since we came, and said that if he never met us here on
earth again, he hoped to in heaven. We sent him some food suitable
for him.</p>

<p>We see so much destitution that we can’t help giving until we feel
it. We do almost entirely without butter, and frequently without
sugar. We live very plainly, but contentedly. One man told in
church how much good it did him, when Mr. C. visited him last
summer, and assured him that his child was not past recovery. It
was a long ride of fourteen miles on horseback under a burning
Southern sun; but it greatly encouraged these humble Christians.
They are so ignorant that when they get sick, they think somebody
has poisoned them. They do not seem to have any confidence in each
other. One young woman, who spent five years with Miss Douglass,
assured me that she would not take medicine from a colored doctor,
if he was ever so well educated—“Because I am afraid he might be
mad at me and poison me.” It seems discouraging when years of good
training fail to eradicate such silly notions.</p>

<p>We are in a Ku Klux neighborhood, twenty white families within a
mile of us; but only three of these have ever made us a social call.</p>

<p>Our children have no associates. I am<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a> glad that there are six of
them and not just one or two.</p>

<p>We are obliged to keep one of the older children out of school to
take care of the babies, aged two and four years. I think it would
be a sin to leave them in the care of any of these colored people,
the greater part of each day. They are so ignorant and sinful and
superstitious, that I am sure they would poison their young minds.
Perhaps that is the reason the Southern people have given so much
trouble, they have had such ignorant nurses.</p>

<p>Our Sunday-school is large and doing well. We have large classes
because we have so few competent teachers; we are trying to train
others. Church services are well attended. Our work is made up
of lights and shades, but we like it, and thank the Lord that He
permits us to be humble workers in this part of His vineyard.</p>

<h3>GEORGIA.</h3>

<h4>A Struggling Church—A Growing Temperance Work—Hindrances.</h4>

<p class="secauth">REV. J. R. M<sup>c</sup>LEAN, NO. 1 MILLER STATION.</p>

<p>The school is doing well. I have enrolled 67 now, and have larger
scholars than at any time before. The Sunday-school is growing in
numbers and also in interest, and its work has had great power over
the people here for good.</p>

<p>The church has been pulling together quite well, and has raised
towards the work here about $30. A number of the people are not
able to do anything, for they need some one to help them to get
bread. None have joined the church this year thus far; still I hope
to have some come in before the year closes.</p>

<p>We have our house all ceiled inside, and now we are trying to get
it painted. I <em>do</em> wish we could find some one to give us some
singing books, both for Sunday-school and church. We have only
three that we can use in worship. I like the “Songs of Devotion,”
but then anything else will do if we can get that.</p>

<p>The Temperance Society is doing good, but there is room for it to
do much more. At our meeting last Sabbath, five joined us. The band
numbers now about 50. Some, as might be expected, have broken their
pledges. I find it is those who are trained in our schools, and
those only, that take hold of our principles.</p>

<p>O, if more could be done for the children, and for a larger number
of them, there would be some hope for the race yet! What can be
done for them?</p>

<p>The white people are doing nothing to help them, as I shall tell
you when I get to it. But the old ones find it hard to leave off
the habits of slavery, which have been going on so long that they
have taken deep root, and how they are to be dug out I cannot tell.
But will not our Heavenly Father overlook many of these wicked
habits!</p>

<p>Our church grows slowly because we are trying all the time to get
the people out of their old ways, which most of the people like
best, and so they are held by the other churches.</p>

<p>The large rice planters are doing nothing for them, only to keep
them on their farms and get all the work out of them they can, and
pay them as little as possible for their work. How is this done?</p>

<p>By giving them great feasts on the Sabbath. At these feasts they
have the colored people come into the big house (this means the
white people’s house) and shout for them, as it is called here, but
I call it dancing. They are given ginger snaps, rum and wine. This
kind of a party, or feast, or shout, was given last Sunday (they
are called by all these names). I am told that the colored people
on a certain plantation ate two boxes of ginger snaps, and drank
two gallons of wine and four gallons of rum. They have them on the
Sabbath so as not to stop the work.</p>

<p>This is the way they hold them. I said in my haste last Sabbath,
if the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a> white man was to tell them that on the other side of Hell
they could get as much rum and wine as they could get free, many of
them would try to cross over. Many of them have given up all they
have for it, and will go anywhere to get it. This is awful, but it
is the truth. Our work will tell in the end in saving those that
believe. Please excuse any rough expressions, but this is not half
like it is. I am not able to tell just how the people do act here;
still they are my people, and I must do all for them I can. Pray
for me, that I may have courage to do my part of the work.</p>

<h4>A Lady’s Sunday-School and Missionary Work.</h4>

<p class="secauth">MISS O. B. BABCOCK, MACON.</p>

<p>My infant class in Sunday-school has grown from five to forty-five
since I came; and, as I visit all my scholars, it keeps me busy.
Monday afternoons I give to practising music in the Sunday-school;
Wednesday, we have our school prayer-meeting; Thursday, a mother’s
meeting, for prayer and conversation. This last has always been an
interesting feature in my labors among the poor, and I trust it
will be so here. Friday evening, I have a meeting for Bible-reading
and prayer in the cabins near by. The reading is greatly enjoyed
by the people. Sunday evenings I usually spend in the same way.
Saturday, at 2 <span class="medium">P.M.</span>, I have the sewing-school, numbering
seventy-five, and weekly increasing in numbers and interest. The
mothers are delighted, and the children not less so. As the entire
burden of the work rests on me, with no white help, you can see
that my moments at home are all occupied with cutting and basting.
I have finally succeeded in getting some colored teachers, and may,
in time, have help in preparing work. I try to visit the homes of
all the scholars, that I may know their condition and needs. This
is one of the very best means of access to the people, and helps
to fill up the Sunday-school with needy ones. I feel as much at
home as if I had always lived here, and can go to any part of the
city with perfect ease. I have visited Vineville, Unionville, East
Macon, Tybee, Sandy Bottom, etc., the suburbs of the city.</p>

<p>There was one dear old colored aunty here who was sick for months,
but always so tender and thoughtful of me that my visits were a
comfort and even pleasure. She went home last week, after a blessed
death, singing with her last breath: “I’se passed over Jordan!
Hallelu! Hallelu!” I wouldn’t have believed that I should miss her
as I do. I don’t find many like her.</p>

<p>I feel very grateful for the barrels that I have received; I
have received one barrel from Boston, a cask and barrel from
Newburyport, one from Wentworth, N. H., one from Chicago. I have
written letters to nine different Sunday-schools, and keep up a
constant correspondence with my own church and Sunday-school, also
with the Ladies’ Society in it. This was at first a burden to me,
but it becomes easier and more of a pleasure. I find I have made
150 calls during January, and though this is not a large number,
still it implies a great many miles of walking. I often can make
but one or two calls in half a day, the distances are so great
and there is no way to ride. I have spent a great many hours in
teaching children their A B C’s and reading to them. I carry
primers with me and find plenty of teaching to do.</p>

<h4>A Communion Season—District Meetings.</h4>

<p class="secauth">MISS E. W. DOUGLAS, M<sup>c</sup>INTOSH, LIBERTY CO.</p>

<p>It was our Communion Sabbath and eleven united with the church,
one by letter. Five were baptized, four by sprinkling, one by
immersion. While a few went to the water to witness that ordinance,
the many gathered in the church for a season of prayer, and I think
that hour gave tone to the services of the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a> day. I have seldom,
if ever, seen so much quietness and seriousness in so large a
gathering of this emotional people as there was that day. I refer
to the greetings after the close of the service. There is usually
much loud talking and laughing. The lesson of the morning hour was
that they should not forget that the object of the Lord’s table
was not to draw a crowd together to meet one another, but to meet
the Lord and “remember” Him, and the chapter read and explained by
the pastor when he returned from the water led our thoughts to the
Crucified One. Three of those who united with the church professed
conversion during the week of prayer.</p>

<p>As the members of this church are so widely scattered that it is
difficult for the pastor to visit them often, they are arranged in
seven districts, each having its “watchman,” whose duty it is to
sustain district prayer-meetings and to report to the pastor any
thing needing his attention. I have attended one of these district
meetings, and hope to attend at least one every week.</p>

<h4>Church and School must Work Together.</h4>

<p class="secauth">REV. S. E. LATHROP, MACON.</p>

<p>During the last session of the Georgia Conference at Savannah, a
debate took place on the subject of the church and school work as
of necessity going together in this Southern field, which impressed
me deeply. It was mainly carried on by the young colored brethren,
both ministers and laymen, and in matter and manner showed that
they knew whereof they spoke, and were deeply impressed with its
importance. Any person who may have doubted the vital necessity
of the school to the church work here, would surely have been
convinced by the earnest arguments of these brethren, most of
whom came to the church through the educational department of the
mission work.</p>

<p>Said one young preacher: “The school is the primary department
of the church. It trains the children and youth to think, and
hence to accept of a thoughtful religion like ours, instead of
the mere shouting and emotional style to which the ignorant and
untrained cling. The true religion is one which teaches us to love
God and our neighbor supremely, and this can be done best by the
intelligence which comes only through the school training.”</p>

<p>Another said: “Our people never had any mental training, or any
encouragement to think for themselves, and did not know how, until
the A. M. A. schools awakened these powers. We, as a race, are not
naturally a reasoning people. We are too much governed by impulse,
by emotion, by instinct, by passions, and too easily offended, with
little self-control. Slavery was a very poor mental discipline,
and when freedom came, there were many extravagant ideas and
ignorant impulses that led the people to extremes. The utter lack
of public schools for our race made us at first prize most highly
the advantages offered so generously by the A. M. A. Afterward,
as the slumbering intelligence slowly awoke, we saw not only the
intrinsic value of education, but we were more able to appreciate
the kindness which suggested the sending of these faithful teachers
and missionaries. Gratitude prompted us, in many cases, to break
away from the old superstitious churches, and growing enlightenment
helps us to see more clearly the superior advantages of an
intelligent religion. The consecrated teachers of the Association
have many of them done grand missionary work, although very few of
them are open to the charge of sectarianism. Congregationalism, by
its broad, liberal, unsectarian policy of churches and schools, has
done a vast amount of good to all the other denominations. They
are being leavened more and more by true intelligence, and the
ancient foundations of ignorance and hierarchy <a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a>are slowly giving
way. Upon their ruins shall arise more beautiful temples to God,
more enlightened worship, more worthy conceptions of daily life and
religious duty.”</p>

<p>Another speaker claimed that “The day-school brings about sympathy
of the day scholars with the church and Sunday-school work. The
religious exercises of the schools cause the impression that there
is a soul as well as a brain to be trained. The knowledge that the
teachers are universally engaged in Sunday-school work, by the very
law of cause and effect, calls attention to that work also. The
sympathy that always exists between the preacher and teachers, and
the hearty interest in the children that is shown by the ministers,
cause both parents and children to think that the work is all one,
as it really is. New England ‘blossoms as the rose’ to-day, because
the church and the school-house have always been built together,
and in their mutual work are as inseparable as the Siamese twins.
May the day hasten when it shall be so in the South.”</p>

<p>The young delegate from Atlanta said: “The first church of Atlanta
is the outgrowth of the Storrs School, whose devoted teachers have
always sought after the spiritual as well as the mental welfare
of their scholars. They have been true missionaries and worthy
co-laborers in the Gospel with the pastors of the church.”</p>

<p>A young preacher, who is also the successful teacher of the
day-school in his parish, said that “The training of the school
children to be punctual at the morning roll-call, teaches also
the very necessary habit of punctuality at church, in which our
people are so deficient. The promptness, the discipline of order,
cleanliness, good behavior and attention, which is taught in
school, has also a corresponding effect in the church services.
If our people were educated and enlightened, perhaps the church
could get on without the school; but in their ignorance they must
be taught to think, before they can get a right idea of Bible
religion. The intellect must go with the heart, preparing the way
for the coming of the Lord. Superstition is still a formidable
enemy in our church work, and nothing but sanctified intelligence
will ever defeat that adversary.”</p>

<p>Said another delegate: “I came into the church through the
night-school. I was working hard all day and could not attend
day-school, but went at night and studied as well as I could. There
I first heard of the Congregational church. I found by inquiry that
it was a church which had been very active in the anti-slavery
times, and believed in free speech, free schools, free churches and
equal rights in church and state. That attracted me, and I inquired
more, until finally God forgave my sins and I united with the
church. I love more and more the freedom and fraternity I find, and
I believe in the church, which makes so much of schools, and has
educated so many of my people.”</p>

<p>Said another: “The church must go with the school, because
education alone only sharpens the mind for greater mischief. In
the very nature of things, every school teacher ought to be a true
Christian, to exert a Christ-like influence in the school, to
encourage pupils to attend church and Sunday-school. The teacher’s
power is greater over scholars here than in the North.”</p>

<p>Dr. Roy spoke of the many mission Sunday-schools and churches which
had sprung up around Talladega College, the result of labor by the
Christian students. He also recalled the history of the mission
schools in India, which, on account of some complaints, were at one
time given up, to the great detriment of the missions.</p>

<p>This is but an outline of the remarks made upon this important
subject, which would have cheered the hearts of all<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a>
philanthropists to hear. The decorum and general manner of
expression throughout would have done honor to the most dignified
deliberative body.</p>

<h3>ALABAMA.</h3>

<p class="section">Notes from Marion.</p>

<p class="secauth">MRS. GEO. E. HILL.</p>

<p>Sundays are our grand working days. As we have services morning and
night, the afternoon is left free to meet the people in other ways.</p>

<p>Sometimes the women come to the “Home” for a prayer-meeting, or
the little children come in to hear Bible-stories told or read.
Sometimes I have a Bible-reading for <em>boys</em>. They come, bringing
their Bibles, and pencil and paper, and I read them some of the
precious verses marked in my own Bible, or choose some story like
that of the Shunamite, which they are not familiar with.</p>

<p>Many of them read imperfectly, and so lose the full meaning of
the words, and we find that the “old, old story” becomes new and
strangely sweet as we read it aloud to them, with fresh emphasis
and expression.</p>

<p>An old man once said to me, “If I had a hundred dollar bill, I’d
give it in a minute if I could read the Bible.”</p>

<p>Last Sunday, I invited several boys to come and see me. I seated
them round a table, and gave them eight or ten copies of “Life
and Light” and “Missionary Herald” to look over. Choosing for my
text the <em>pictures</em>, I talked an hour with them, and selected an
interesting fact or incident for each one to give that night at our
monthly missionary meeting.</p>

<p>A fine, large missionary map has been donated to the church by the
Sunday school in Weymouth, Mass., which is very useful in showing
the people the great world, about which they know so little.</p>

<p>The girls’ sewing-class has sent $38 to the Mendi Mission.</p>

<p>Our Sunday-school numbers about eighty, and is the pleasantest
and most orderly school I have seen at the South. The children
come to their classes neatly dressed, after the Saturday’s washing
and ironing, and give quiet attention during the hour. We find
blackboard illustrations helpful in fixing the thoughts of the
lesson. One Sunday, twenty maps of Palestine were handed in, in
connection with the lesson.</p>

<p>The Sunday-school concerts are a special attraction, and are
attended by many from other churches. At our last, several
prominent white citizens were present.</p>

<p>We wish our friends at the North could see how well these colored
children carry through the Bible Exercises and other recitations.</p>

<p>Every Monday at 4 <span class="medium">P. M.</span>, the women meet at the “Home” for
an hour of prayer. They have no clocks to tell the time by; but as
most of them live in sight, I hang a white flag on the gatepost,
fifteen minutes before the hour. We call this our “Gospel flag!”</p>

<p>The prayers of these women are marked by an unquestioning trust.
They ask directly for what they want, without getting entangled in
the formalities of more educated Christians, and they evidently
feel that they speak into a listening ear.</p>

<p>Their faces often beam with pleasure as they hear the reading
of the Bible. “What a glorious chapter this is!—it <em>feels so
holy</em>!”—one of them said.</p>

<p>They need these hours of prayer, for life with them is hard, and
pinched, and poor, and in their small houses of one or two rooms,
full of little children, washing and ironing, and cooking, these
mothers have no “closet” where they may shut themselves in for
communion with Jesus, and get patience and strength for the day.
But are not their prayers heard, as they stand by the tub, washing
for the rich?—or bend over the cradle, in which, for some, there is
always a baby—or<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a> cook the meal, which to us would seem so scanty?
A woman once told me, that in slavery times, she went down in the
garden, among the butter-beans, to pray—and there she had such a
season of joy, that when she came in, and took her place at her
master’s table, to brush away the flies, “’pear’d like glory was in
de fly-brush!”</p>

<p>For the last five months, we have had an afternoon school for
children under 14 years of age, here at the “Home.” A large room
on the back gallery was fitted up for them, and here twenty-five
children come every day and are taught from 1 to 4 o’clock.</p>

<p>Besides the ordinary book lessons, their young teacher instructs
them in good manners, neatness and simple fancy-work, and gives
each day a half-hour talk on birds, plants or animals, illustrated
by pictures on the blackboard.</p>

<p>The children are quick to learn and eager for all kinds of
information, which they take home and repeat to their parents, when
the work of the day is done.</p>

<p>Some of these parents who cannot even read themselves, are “proud”
to hear their children talk intelligently about Washington, or
Napoleon, or Henry Bergh.</p>

<p>This is our third winter among the Freedmen, but we feel that we
are just learning how to be missionaries, and how to get at the
people, and meet them in their great needs. Are we happy in our
work? Yes; happy and content. Even in our “small corner” we have
the Master’s presence, and feel it a privilege to work among His
lowly ones.</p>

<h3>MISSISSIPPI.</h3>

<h4>A Brother’s Devotion.</h4>

<p class="secauth">MRS. G. STANLEY POPE, TOUGALOO.</p>

<p>When we first came to Tougaloo, two years ago last fall, we found
a young man who had been here a few days, Frank H——. He had run
away from his uncle, because of his cruelty to him. He was then
about nineteen years old. He was anxious to get an education;
and although he had not a cent of money, he proved to be such a
faithful boy, both at his books and at work, that with but little
help he managed to earn his board and pay his way in school. He
had been a very wicked boy, but Christ wrought a great change in
him, and before the year closed, he became a most conscientious
Christian.</p>

<p>He remained right here, working on the farm during the summer, and
studying when school was in session, until about two months ago,
when he left and went to work. He had often spoken of a sister who
was still with his uncle, and he was anxious to get her away, and
have her in school. A little over a week ago, he received his pay
for his work, and went to get his sister. He tried to persuade
his uncle to let her go, but he would not listen to it, and said
she should never leave him. Frank found out from her that she was
greatly abused, and that she wanted to leave and come with him. She
is not more than fourteen years old, and small for her age, but
when Frank found her she was burning brush and helping to clear up
new land. Her whole work has been in the field, plowing and hoeing,
picking cotton and “pulling fodder.”</p>

<p>Frank finally made up his mind to “kidnap” her; so a little after
dark, when she was feeding the mules, he told her his plan, and
they left at once for the swamp, as it would be less easy to track
them there. After going through that, they walked till nearly
midnight to get to a railroad station farther away than the one
they usually went to, as Frank knew his uncle would be down there
in the morning to find them. The girl, whose name by the way is
Leah, had no clothing on except a cotton dress and a bit of an
old shawl over her head; so, early in the morning,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a> Frank went
to a store and got calico for two dresses, and hired them made,
both being finished (after a fashion) by night, he paying a dollar
apiece for the work. He also bought her some shoes and a few other
things, and a little after dark they took the cars for this place,
arriving here about midnight. Frank stayed over the Sabbath, and
then went back to his work to earn money to keep her in school. He
said to me, “she’s all the sister I’ve got, and I want her to do
well.” She did not know a letter, but she is quick and bright, and
during the few days she has been in school she has done well; she
knows nothing about housework, but is willing and tries to learn.
I asked her yesterday if she knew about God. “Not much.” “Have you
ever been to Sabbath-school?” “No.” “Ever been to church?” “Twice.”
“Do you know about Jesus?” “Never heard of him.”</p>

<p>Oh, Christian women of the North! do you need to go to India or
Turkey to find heathen? I assure you, Leah is not an isolated case;
she is a fair sample of thousands in the South.</p>

<p>Your “Woman’s Board of Missions” is doing a good work for God and
humanity. I would not underestimate its value; but while you are
responding so liberally to the calls for help from afar, are you
not forgetting this work of no less importance which lies nearer
to you, the work of giving Christian education to the despised and
degraded colored women of the South?</p>

<p>We are very sorry to have Frank out of school. He can not afford
it, neither can you afford it, for if he could be in school for
one or two years longer, he would make a very fair teacher for the
country schools.</p>

<p>He hopes to be here next year; but if he has to clothe himself and
his sister, and pay seven dollars apiece a month for their board,
I don’t see much chance for him. Does any one feel called upon to
take the responsibility of her board bill?</p>

<h4>Report</h4>

<p class="hang"><i>Of the State Superintendent of Public Education to His
Excellency Governor J. M. Stone, and the Honorable Legislature of
the State of Mississippi.</i></p>

<h5>TOUGALOO UNIVERSITY.</h5>

<p>This institution, under the direction and control of the American
Missionary Association, is doing a most excellent work in the
education of the colored youth of the State. For a number of years
after its establishment an annual appropriation was made by the
State, supplementary to the funds contributed by the Society, and
a Board of Trustees was appointed on the part of the State. This
Board still exists; but inasmuch as the last Legislature failed
to make appropriation for the University, and as the property
belongs to the Missionary Society, it would appear to be useless.
The Principal, writing on the 20th of December, 1879, says:
“The improvement in the school is very marked. This is seen in
the general training of students, in the greater number who are
desiring to complete the regular course of study, the increased
number in attendance in the higher grades, in more frequent visits
from patrons, and by the friends it is making among the whites
where our students have been at work.</p>

<p>The management of the institution is admirable, its teachers
are superior, and everything connected with it is in excellent
condition, as I have had occasion to learn from personal
observation. As a recognition of the good work being done by the
American Missionary Association in the education and elevation of
the colored people of the State, it is recommended that a liberal
appropriation be made, that it may be rendered still more useful.”</p>

<h3>LOUISIANA.</h3>

<p class="section">Revival in the Central Church—Theological Department—Church
Dedication.</p>

<p class="secauth">REV. W. S. ALEXANDER.</p>

<p>The hope expressed in my last letter that I might have glad tidings
to send you, has been fully realized, and it is my happiness to
record one of the most precious revivals in the history of the
Central Church. I do not forget the history of the past four years,
and the seasons of spiritual awakening through which the church
has passed. The present movement differs from the preceding, if
at all, in a more intelligent grasp of the truth, and in a deeper
spiritual tone. The past summer was a time of preparation for the
scenes that were to follow. The Revival was the constant theme
of conversation and prayer. It was the one burden upon their
hearts. Sunday, January 4, the first day of the week of prayer,
was marked by evident signs of deepening interest. On that day,
eight were received to the church, of whom three came on profession
of their faith. For twenty-seven consecutive evenings, we met in
our lecture room. The Gospel was preached with directness and
earnestness. A “church in earnest” took hold of the work and
pressed it forward. Beginning with an audience of 75, the numbers
in constant attendance rapidly increased to 200. The interest
suffered no diminution to the last night, when six came forward to
the “mourners’ seats” with the cry, “Pray for us.” Some continued
in an anxious state for two, three or four weeks, while others,
coming in from motives of curiosity merely, were stricken down by
God’s Spirit, and as quickly brought into the light and liberty of
believers.</p>

<p>An old man of 70 years was brought into the Kingdom, and is as
happy as the youngest convert. Another, much in political life, and
who publicly said, “I have been an awful sinner,” seems now to be a
reformed and converted man.</p>

<p>Four of our University students have joyfully professed Christ.</p>

<p>While incidents occurred daily which touched our hearts, and added
to the tenderness and deep solemnity of our meetings, they cannot
of course be faithfully recorded, and I do not attempt it.</p>

<p>Let me say that there was no undue excitement, and not the
slightest approach to merely physical and emotional demonstrations.
The work was too intelligent, too spiritual for that. In prayer, in
song, and in appeal, human agency was forgotten, and the converting
power of the Divine Spirit was reverently recognized.</p>

<p>Sunday, Feb. 1st, was our “Feast of Ingathering.” Of the <em>thirty</em>
converted in the meetings, twenty-four were received to the
fellowship of the church, with two who came to us by letter. The
people brought flowers for the pulpit and communion-table. Of the
250 present in the audience, 150 received the sacrament. “The Lord
hath done great things for us whereof we are glad.”</p>

<p><i>The Theological Department</i> is larger than in any previous
year. It numbers twenty members, young men of zeal and promise,
not only willing but eager to be instructed in the truths and
doctrines of God’s word. Four of the class are ordained ministers,
of whom two are pastors of churches in New Orleans. Not all of
them have the ministry in view. Those who have not, are hoping
through this instruction to become more useful and efficient in
the church. Three theological lectures are given each week, and
there are besides sermons given by the students before the class
for criticism, and discussions on religious topics. Our great
lack is books of reference. We have no systems of theology, and
no commentaries to which the young men can have access. In the
“good time coming,” these we trust will be supplied, and so the
efficiency of the department be increased.</p>

<p><i>Church Dedication.</i>—In response to an earnest invitation from the
Congregational Church in New Iberia, I went down on Saturday, the
14th inst., to<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a> assist in the dedication of their new church. The
terrific windstorm of last September laid their tasteful and really
beautiful house of worship in ruins. The building was a total
wreck. The storm, as it swept up the bayou, left only desolation
in its track. The people, with commendable energy and self-denial,
bating not one jot of heart or hope, set themselves to the work of
rebuilding. They purchased more ground, put up a larger and better
building, and the machinery of the church is again in working
order. They have expended something like $450, and urgently need
$200 more for painting and furnishing. The people feel that they
have exhausted their resources. It is a noble enterprise, and
should be encouraged. Loyalty to our Congregational polity in
Louisiana should call forth a hearty response to their appeal. At
the service of dedication, the house was crowded to its utmost
capacity. Both morning and night the word was received with all
readiness and gladness of heart. Southern Louisiana is a beautiful
country, unsurpassed for productiveness, and should be dotted all
over with churches where the Gospel in its simplicity, clearness
and power may be preached. God speed the day!</p>

<h3>TENNESSEE.</h3>

<p class="section">Revival in Fisk University.</p>

<p class="secauth">PROF. H. S. BENNETT.</p>

<p>A quiet but deep work of grace has been in progress since the week
of prayer in our institution. The week of prayer was observed as
usual with us, but without any special increase of interest. The
question then came up, “Shall we pass through the year without our
usual work of grace?” This led to earnest prayer and consecration
on the part of teachers and Christian students. The result was
soon perceptible in greater earnestness among Christians, and
a wide-spread spirit of inquiry among the impenitent. At this
point the attendance on the half-hour prayer meetings was largely
increased. From six to ten inquirers presented themselves for
prayers from night to night, and from this time the work went
forward. Four students were converted on one Sabbath, and others
were brought out into the light. Thus the work went forward
hopefully but quietly, until, up to this time, fourteen students
have expressed a hope in Christ. This is the second season of
interest during the present scholastic year. Before Christmas, a
brief season of spiritual awakening brought seven students out
upon the Lord’s side, so that the results of the year have been
twenty-one conversions. Several others are still inquiring, and the
work goes on, though with less manifest power than a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>The results of the revival have been seen in the deepening of the
earnestness of Christians, so that much of the power of the good
work does not appear.</p>

<h3>CHURCH—CHRISTMAS—BIBLES.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. MYRON EELLS, S’KOKOMISH, WASH. TER.</p>

<p>The first Sabbath in this year we received five members into our
church, three of them on profession of faith, two of whom were our
older scholars. One of the scholars whom we received a year ago
died some time since. It was on the Sabbath, and after his brother,
also a member, had returned from church, he took his brother’s hand
and held it until he died, urging him to hold steadfast to his
Christian profession to the end.</p>

<p>We have, to our great regret, been<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a> obliged to discipline two
others for misconduct, suspending them for three months.</p>

<p>On Christmas I arranged so that a dinner was prepared for the
oldest Indians, who are unable to support themselves. They enjoyed
it, coming through storm, snow and cold in order to get it. It was
the first affair of the kind we have had for them alone. Between
Government and the Indians, feasts have been prepared for the
Indians in general, but never for the old decrepit ones. They are
nearly always neglected.</p>

<p>For more than two years I have been serving as Local Agent of our
Territorial Bible Society. On making my report for the last year,
I find that I have sold books to the amount of $32.19, viz. thirty
Bibles and forty-five Testaments. Of these, twenty-one Bibles and
eighteen Testaments have been bought by the Indians, for which they
have paid $22.72. These have varied in price from the five-cent
Testament to the royal octavo Bible, gilt, reference, the latter
having been for a newly married couple, both of whom have been in
school.</p>

<h3>OUR NEW FIELDS.</h3>

<p>It will be remembered by such of our friends as keep a close
watch of our movements, that on or about the first of February,
we commenced work in three new fields, Oroville, Grass Valley and
Marysville. They will read with interest the subjoined extracts
from letters already received:</p>

<p><i>Marysville.</i>—I requested Lee Haim to stop at Marysville, on his
way to Oroville, and spend the Sabbath there, preaching as he had
opportunity. I also invited Lem Chung, our helper at Sacramento,
to accompany him, and to spend a week there assisting to start the
school. A postal from Lee Haim and Lem Chung, written in Chinese
and addressed to “The Brethren of the Congregational Association
of Christian Chinese,” has been translated for me as follows:
“Dear Brethren, We write to tell you that we arrived safely in
Marysville a little after 4 <span class="medium">P. M.</span> An hour later we went to
Chinatown, and on the street we preached to our countrymen. A large
crowd was gathered at first by our singing, and they listened to
both preaching and singing with great interest. At 7 o’clock the
same evening, we had so large an audience in our school-room that
many went away on account of lacking seats. Our hearts were filled
with joy, and we preached to them from the Chinese Testament, and
explained to them the meaning of the hymns we sang. We trust the
seed sown will soon spring up to a good harvest. Our countrymen
here in school treat us very kindly, and we know this is due to
your and Mr. Pond’s prayers. Please pray for us continually.”</p>

<p>Miss Mattie A. Flint, the teacher, writes: “I have 25 names on
the roll, <a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a>with an average attendance of about 15. They all take
a great deal of interest, especially in the singing. Already they
can sing three or four of the hymns on the card very well. We
have organized a Sunday-school. Visitors drop in occasionally and
express much interest. I myself am deeply interested, and will do
all in my power to teach them of their Heavenly Father. They are
learning to read very fast.” The Christian co-operation of Rev. P.
L. Carden, pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Marysville, has
much to do with the good promise of the work there.</p>

<p><i>Grass Valley.</i>—Rev. F. B. Perkins reports orally, that he
has succeeded in renting a school-room already tolerably well
furnished, and expects to pay the rent by donations made upon the
field. The average attendance thus far is but eight—owing partly,
perhaps, to the fact that the school-room is rather remote from the
Chinese quarter. But there is a good prospect of increase. I wish I
could dare to send a helper to each of these points.</p>

<p><i>Oroville.</i>—Lee Haim wrote as follows after spending a fortnight in
his new field: “The school was opened on the 5th day of this month”
(the room not being ready before). “Only had school two evenings.
Then we have vacation two days for New Year’s. At New Year’s day I
made a call at every store (Chinese) in Oroville. On the second day
of our new year I went to the other Chinese town three miles from
here, and when I reached there I first made a call on every store.
After that I preach to them and sing several hymns in Chinese in
the opening” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i>, of his street service). “It seems to me,
by my own judgment (so far as I could judge) they were pleased to
hear. Twenty were present at our last prayer-meeting, and when
the school was opened again, the school-room was quite crowded. I
hope the Almighty God will send His Holy Spirit to remove (move)
their heart, and still lead them coming; that they may hear this
wonderful word, and repent, to be the children of God.”</p>

<p>At a later date Miss Waterbury writes: “We are going on very well,
and have as many as we can teach with any degree of profit. Last
night I should judge there were fifty or more. It is impossible to
tell the exact number, as many come in, take a lesson, and leave
before the school is closed. Two-thirds, I should think, began at
A B C. Many of these are now spelling words. [After less than a
fortnight’s instruction.—W. C. P.] Last night I had twelve or more
in their letters, and taught them from a card hung upon the wall,
till lungs and strength gave out. Among them were two little boys
about six years old, uncommonly smart and quick. Several old men
have been spelling “dog,” “man,” etc. with great patience. The
school is a new thing and creates much interest. Sometimes several
will crowd around, looking over the shoulder and listening eagerly
to the one who reads. I do not think this will always last, but I
think there is a great field here for good. Oh, to be filled with
the spirit of God, that I may be the channel of grace to these dark
souls! Who is sufficient for these things?”</p>

<p>I add an extract from a letter from Miss Helen E. Clarke, teacher
in one of our old fields—Santa Barbara. It is written in the
familiar terms of a friendly correspondence, and not at all as a
formal report; but it gives, for that, all the more graphic picture
of the “ups and downs” of our work:</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to say that Ah Sing has left Santa Barbara.
We shall miss him very much in the school. He went to the gold
mines in Mexico, I think. He said he would write you when he got
there. Gin Gem took the wash-house, [previously carried on by Ah
Sing.—W. C. P.] It makes quite a difference whom they have there,
and I am very glad he has it, for I think him a <a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a>very good boy. He
said the reason he wanted the place was, so that he could come to
school every night. He and Gin Foy expect to unite with our church
to-morrow.”</p>


<h4>EDWARD P. SANFORD,</h4>

<p>a director in our California Auxiliary, from its organization, for
many years Superintendent of the Chinese Sunday-school of the First
Congregational Church in Oakland, was transferred to the church
above on Feb. 16th. A fearless friend of all who are unbefriended
by the world at large, an eager, efficient and prayerful follower
of Jesus, a strong pillar in the church, a man who united a careful
and intense energy and an unflinching and unspotted integrity,
with the gentleness and kindliness sometimes supposed to adorn
womanhood alone, genial, generous, helpful everywhere,—how <em>can</em> we
spare him? But how high and holy and beneficent must be the service
prepared for him above, since the Master who never mistakes,
thought good to take him there!</p>

<h3>A VOYAGE TO AFRICA—PROF. CHASE TO HIS FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="smcap">My Dear Little Boy:</p>

<p>It is a good many days since papa left you and mamma, and he has
been sailing on the water most all of the time. I was in the boat
that you and mamma left me on twelve days, as many as you have
fingers on both hands and two more. Then I was on land three
nights. Then I came on this ship, and have slept on it as many
nights as you and mamma both have fingers on your two hands. The
little beds on this boat are just like those you saw.</p>

<p>The boat stopped a little while at some places, and I saw people
without much clothes, like the pictures you saw in the book, and
little boys and girls, as big as you, who had not any clothes at
all. They did not seem to care; but I think they would feel very
fine if they had nice little sailor suits like yours. These black
people eat real funny. On the little boats that came out to get
things from this big boat they had little stoves with one pot. A
boy about as big as Johnnie C——, with no clothes but one piece
tied around him—no hat, no shirt, no coat, no pants, no socks, no
shoes—made the fire and cooked the food. He took some fishes that
he had caught in the water and cut them into small pieces, and then
took some rice, and put the pieces of fish and the rice into the
pot over the fire with some water in it. Then he put something into
a hole in a big log and pounded it with the end of a shovel-handle,
and when he had pounded it enough he poured it on the fish and rice
in the pot. By and by he poured what was in the pot into a large
tray and all the men began to eat. But they did not eat as we do.
They did not have any plates, nor any knives, nor any forks. They
just had one spoon. One took this spoon and ate a little, and then
handed it to another and he ate a little. The others put their
hands into the tray and took out a handful of the fish and rice
and made it up into a ball, as boys where you are make snow-balls,
and then ate it as people eat apples. I don’t think you would like
to have your papa and mamma eat in that way, and I don’t think
you would like to eat just fish and rice, no meat, no potatoes,
no bread, no butter, no pie, no cake. But the rich people here in
Africa have <em>some</em> nice things to eat. Mr. Smith<a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a> bought a lot of
nice oranges for about a cent apiece. They were real sweet and
juicy and do not make my teeth sore, and we have some real nice
bananas—I wish you and mother had some of them—and where we are to
stop next, pine-apples grow.</p>

<p>It is not cold here as it is where you are. The sun is real hot
and the trees are all covered with leaves and oranges, and bananas
and pine-apples are growing on the trees and just getting ripe. I
expect to leave this ship to-morrow. The next day will be Sunday,
and we shall spend that day in Sierra Leone. Then we are to ride in
a small boat that black men will make go with their oars, like that
boat the boy took us to see the soldiers in last summer, when you
were just a little afraid it would tip over and spill us out into
the water. Don’t you remember?</p>

<p>So in four days more we are to stop going, going, going on the
water, and live on the land in a house once more.</p>

<p class="center nomargin">From your loving papa,</p>
<p class="right nomargin">T. N. C.</p>

<p class="p1">P. S.—We reached Sierra Leone Sunday morning, and found a little
steamer bound for Good Hope, to which we have been transferred. We
went ashore yesterday and attended church at the Wesleyan Mission,
at which a native minister preached, and took lunch with Rev. Dr.
Godman, who is in charge of the Wesleyan Missions. The boat is to
leave at 12 to-day, and we plan to go ashore meanwhile.</p>

<p class="section">INCORPORATED JANUARY 30, 1849.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> This Society shall be called “<span class="smcap">The American
Missionary Association</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> The object of this Association shall be to
conduct Christian missionary and educational operations, and
diffuse a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own and other
countries which are destitute of them, or which present open and
urgent fields of effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Any person of evangelical sentiments,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who
professes faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, who is not a slaveholder,
or in the practice of other immoralities, and who contributes to
the funds, may become a member of the Society; and by the payment
of thirty dollars, a life member; provided that children and others
who have not professed their faith may be constituted life members
without the privilege of voting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> This Society shall meet annually, in the month of
September, October or November, for the election of officers and
the transaction of other business, at such time and place as shall
be designated by the Executive Committee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> The annual meeting shall be constituted of
the regular officers and members of the Society at the time of
such meeting, and of delegates from churches, local missionary
societies, and other co-operating bodies, each body being entitled
to one representative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> The officers of the Society shall be a President,
Vice-Presidents, a Recording Secretary, Corresponding Secretaries,
Treasurer, two Auditors, and an Executive Committee of not less
than twelve, of which the Corresponding Secretaries shall be
advisory, and the Treasurer ex-officio, members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> To the Executive Committee shall belong the
collecting and disbursing of funds; the appointing, counselling,
sustaining and dismissing (for just and sufficient reasons)
missionaries and agents; the selection of missionary fields;
and, in general, the transaction of all such business as usually
appertains to the executive committees of missionary and other
benevolent societies; the Committee to exercise no ecclesiastical
jurisdiction over the missionaries; and its doings to be subject
always to the revision of the annual meeting, which shall, by a
reference mutually chosen, always entertain the complaints of any
aggrieved agent or missionary; and the decision of such reference
shall be final.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee shall have authority to fill all vacancies
occurring among the officers between the regular annual meetings;
to apply, if they see fit, to any State Legislature for acts of
incorporation; to fix the compensation, where any is given, of all
officers, agents, missionaries, or others in the employment of the
Society; to make provision, if any, for disabled missionaries, and
for the widows and children of such as are deceased; and to call,
in all parts of the country, at their discretion, special and
general conventions of the friends of missions, with a view to the
diffusion of the missionary spirit, and the general and vigorous
promotion of the missionary work.</p>

<p>Five members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for
transacting business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VIII.</span> This society, in collecting funds, in
appointing officers, agents and missionaries, and in selecting
fields of labor, and conducting the missionary work, will endeavor
particularly to discountenance slavery, by refusing to receive the
known fruits of unrequited labor, or to welcome to its employment
those who hold their fellow-beings as slaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> Missionary bodies, churches or individuals
agreeing to the principles of this Society, and wishing to appoint
and sustain missionaries of their own, shall be entitled to do so
through the agency of the Executive Committee, on terms mutually
agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. X.</span> No amendment shall be made to this Constitution
without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at a
regular annual meeting; nor unless the proposed amendment has been
submitted to a previous meeting, or to the Executive Committee in
season to be published by them (as it shall be their duty to do, if
so submitted) in the regular official notifications of the meeting.</p>

<p>FOOTNOTE:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> By evangelical sentiments, we understand, among
others, a belief in the guilty and lost condition of all men
without a Saviour; the Supreme Deity, Incarnation and Atoning
Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the only Saviour of the world; the
necessity of regeneration by the Holy Spirit, repentance, faith and
holy obedience in order to salvation; the immortality of the soul;
and the retributions of the judgment in the eternal punishment of
the wicked, and salvation of the righteous.</p>

<h2>The American Missionary Association.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>AIM AND WORK.</h3>

<p>To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in a sympathy with
the almost friendless slaves. Since Emancipation it has devoted
its main efforts to preparing the <span class="smcap">Freedmen</span> for their
duties as citizens and Christians in America and as missionaries
in Africa. As closely related to this, it seeks to benefit the
caste-persecuted <span class="smcap">Chinese</span> in America, and to co-operate
with the Government in its humane and Christian policy towards the
<span class="smcap">Indians</span>. It has also a mission in <span class="smcap">Africa</span>.</p>


<h3>STATISTICS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Churches</span>: <i>In the South</i>—In Va., 1; N. C., 5; S. C., 2;
Ga., 13; Ky., 7; Tenn., 4; Ala., 14, La., 12; Miss., 1; Kansas, 2;
Texas, 6. <i>Africa</i>, 2. <i>Among the Indians</i>, 1. Total 70.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Institutions Founded, Fostered or Sustained in the
South.</span>—<i>Chartered</i>: Hampton, Va.; Berea, Ky.; Talladega, Ala.,
Atlanta, Ga.; Nashville, Tenn,; Tougaloo, Miss.; New Orleans, La.;
and Austin, Texas, 8. <i>Graded or Normal Schools</i>: at Wilmington,
Raleigh, N. C.; Charleston, Greenwood, S. C.; Savannah, Macon,
Atlanta, Ga.; Montgomery, Mobile, Athens, Selma, Ala.; Memphis,
Tenn., 12. <a name="Err1" id="Err1"></a><i>Other Schools</i>, 24. Total 44.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teachers, Missionaries and Assistants.</span>—Among the Freedmen,
253; among the Chinese, 21; among the Indians, 9; in Africa, 13.
Total, 296. <span class="smcap">Students</span>—In Theology, 86; Law, 28; in College
Course, 63; in other studies, 7,030. Total, 7,207. Scholars
taught by former pupils of our schools, estimated at 150,000.
<span class="smcap">Indians</span> under the care of the Association, 13,000.</p>


<h3>WANTS.</h3>

<p>1. A steady <span class="medium">INCREASE</span> of regular income to keep pace with
the growing work. This increase can only be reached by <em>regular</em>
and <em>larger</em> contributions from the churches—the feeble as well as
the strong.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Additional Buildings</span> for our higher educational
institutions, to accommodate the increasing numbers of students;
<span class="smcap">Meeting Houses</span> for the new churches we are organizing;
<span class="smcap">More Ministers</span>, cultured and pious, for these churches.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Help for Young Men</span>, to be educated as ministers here
and missionaries to Africa—a pressing want.</p>

<p>Before sending boxes, always correspond with the nearest A. M. A.
office, as below:</p>

<h3>MAGAZINE.</h3>

<p>This Magazine will be sent, gratuitously, if desired, to the
Missionaries of the Association; to Life Members; to all clergymen
who take up collections for the Association; to Superintendents of
Sabbath Schools; to College Libraries; to Theological Seminaries;
to Societies of Inquiry on Missions; and to every donor who does
not prefer to take it as a subscriber, and contributes in a year
not less than five dollars.</p>

<p>Those who wish to remember the <span class="smcap">American Missionary
Association</span> in their last Will and Testament, are earnestly
requested to use the following</p>


<h3>FORM OF A BEQUEST.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I bequeath</span> to my executor (or executors) the sum of ——
dollars in trust, to pay the same in —— days after my decease to
the person who, when the same is payable, shall act as Treasurer
of the ‘American Missionary Association’ of New York City, to be
applied, under the direction of the Executive Committee of the
Association, to its charitable uses and purposes.”</p>

<p>The will should be attested by three witnesses [in some States
three are required—in other States only two], who should write
against their names, their places of residence [if in cities,
their street and number]. The following form of attestation will
answer for every State in the Union: “Signed, sealed, published
and declared by the said [A. B.] as his last Will and Testament,
in presence of us, who, at the request of the said A. B., and in
his presence, and in the presence of each other, have hereunto
subscribed our names as witnesses.” In some States it is required
that the Will should be made at least two months before the death
of the testator.</p>

<p>We have been gratified with the constant tokens of the increasing
appreciation of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> during the past year, and
purpose to spare no effort to make its pages of still greater value
to those interested in the work which it records.</p>

<p>Shall we not have a largely increased subscription list for 1880?</p>

<p>A little effort on the part of our friends, when making their own
remittances, to induce their neighbors to unite in forming Clubs,
will easily double our list, and thus widen the influence of our
Magazine, and aid in the enlargement of our work.</p>

<p>Under able editorial supervision, aided by the steady contributions
of our intelligent missionaries and teachers in all parts of the
field, and with occasional communications from careful observers
and thinkers elsewhere, the <span class="smcap">American Missionary</span> furnishes
a vivid and reliable picture of the work going forward among the
Indians, the Chinamen on the Pacific Coast, and the Freedmen as
citizens in the South and as missionaries in Africa.</p>

<p>It will be the vehicle of important views on all matters affecting
the races among which it labors, and will give a monthly summary of
current events relating to their welfare and progress.</p>

<p>Patriots and Christians interested in the education and
Christianizing of these despised races are asked to read it, and
assist in its circulation. Begin with the next number and the new
year. The price is only Fifty Cents per annum.</p>

<p>The Magazine will be sent gratuitously, if preferred, to the
persons indicated on page 126.</p>

<p>Special attention is invited to the advertising department of
the <span class="smcap">American Missionary</span>. Among its regular readers are
thousands of Ministers of the Gospel, Presidents, Professors and
Teachers in Colleges, Theological Seminaries and Schools; it is,
therefore, a specially valuable medium for advertising Books,
Periodicals, Newspapers, Maps, Charts, Institutions of Learning,
Church Furniture, Bells, Household Goods, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Advertisers are requested to note the moderate price charged for
space in its columns, considering the extent and character of its
circulation.</p>

<p>Advertisements must be received by the <span class="medium">TENTH</span> of the

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
